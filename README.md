# online-cab-booking
This project includes the features and processes of the Online Cab Booking System and connects users
with transportation services through a user-friendly interface. It includes user lists and driver lists to make
it easier for the admin to see the details of users, bookings, drivers and payments. Users can select a cab,
book single or multiple-stop rides, make payments, provide feedback and avail these services by creating
an account. It will digitally manage all the cab bookings of users properly. The system improves
convenience, efficiency, and transparency in booking and managing transportation services.
